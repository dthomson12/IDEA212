 <h2>UX Strategy, User Journeys and Sitemaps</h2>

 <h3>What is UX Strategy?</h3>  
   
<p>It’s the vision of a solution that needs to be validated with real potential customers to prove that it’s desired in the marketplace. Although UX design encompasses numerous details such as visual design, content messaging, and how easy it is for a user to accomplish a task, UX strategy is the ‘Big Picture.’ It is the high-level plan to achieve one or more business goals under conditions of uncertainty.</p>
