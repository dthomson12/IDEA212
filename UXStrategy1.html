 <h2>UX Strategy, User Journeys and Sitemaps</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>What is UX Strategy?</h3>  
   
<p>It’s the vision of a solution that needs to be validated with real potential customers to prove that it’s desired in the marketplace. Although UX design encompasses numerous details such as visual design, content messaging, and how easy it is for a user to accomplish a task, UX strategy is the ‘Big Picture.’ It is the high-level plan to achieve one or more business goals under conditions of uncertainty.</p>

<h4>What parts should be included?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A status of how your user experience as it stands</li>
<li>A vision of how you wish to improve your UX</li>
<li>Anticipated gains from improving your UX</li>
<li>A list of metrics you'll use to measure the ROI of your activities</li>
</ul>
        
<h4>Why a UX Strategy is important</h4>
<ul>
<li>By defining every aspect of your user experience before starting design, you are defining the direction for all of the design. This results in fewer misunderstandings, and less rework and resource waste.</li>
<li>Keep up with user behavior patterns. To be competitive, you need to continue to predict expectations and delight users.</li>
<li>Align around a shared vision.</li>
</ul>
        
<h3>UX Strategy Deliverables: Touchpoints, Empathy Maps & User Journeys</h3>
        
<p><strong>Touchpoints</strong> are all the points at which a user comes into contact with a brand. Part of a good UX strategy is understanding all of the points at which a user may come into contact with the brand.</p>

<ul>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Apps & Mobile Experiences</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Support Services</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
</ul>
        
<p><img src="Touchpoint.jpg"></p>
        
<p><strong>Empathy maps</strong> are a collaborative tool teams can use to gain a deeper insight into their customers. Much like a user persona, an empathy map can represent a group of users, such as a customer segment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use when diving into customer segments.</li>
<li>Elaborate on user personas.</li>
<li>Capture the users thoughts and feelings, worries and aspirations from customer interviews</li>
<li>Build out the "engaging" aspects within a use persona.</li>
</ul>
        
<p><img src="EmpathyMap.png"></p>
        
<p><strong>A journey map</strong> is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal. Typically, the intention is to solve user problems with products / websites / apps etc.</p>

<h3>Journey Map Steps / Best Practices</h3>
<ul>

<li>Understanding your customer's goals (scenarios) and expectations</li>
<li>Unerstand the phases (high level meaningful chunks that tell the high level narrative)</li>
<li>Understand actions, mindsets and emotions throughout the phases.</li>
<li>What did you learn? What opportunities are there within each phase?.</li>
</ul>
