 <h2>User Research and Personas</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>What is a persona?</h3>
  
<p>Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way.</p>
  
<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Help you to understand your users’ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.</li>
<li>Help you step out of yourself. </li>
<li>Help you to recognise that different people have different needs and expectations.</li>
<li>Help you to empathize with the user you’re designing for.</li>
<li>Make the design task at hand less complex as they will guide your ideation processes.</li>
<li><strong>Help you to achieve the goal of creating a good user experience for your target user group</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of personas</h3>
<p>There are 4 different types of personas that can add value to your design project.</p>

<h4>Goal Directed</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does my typical user want to do with my product?</li>
<li>Examine the process and workflow that your user would prefer to utilise in order to achieve their objectives in interacting with your product or service.</li>
<li>There is an assumption that you have already done enough user research to recognise that your product has value to the user.</li>
<li>By examining their goals, you can bring their requirements to life.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Role-Based</h4>
<ul>
<li>Role-based perspectives are data-driven and incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative sources.</li>
<li>Focusses on the user’s role in the organisation. Our designs need to reflect upon the part that our users play in their organisations or wider lives.</li>
<li>An examination of the roles that our users typically play in real life can help inform better product design decisions.</li> 
<ul>
<li>Where will the product be used?</li> 
<li>What’s this role’s purpose?</li> 
<li>What business objectives are required of this role?</li> 
<li>Who else is impacted by the duties of this role?</li> 
<li>What functions are served by this role?</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Engaging</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perspective is rooted in the ability of stories to produce involvement and insight.</li>
<li>Through an understanding of characters and stories, it is possible to create a vivid and realistic description of fictitious people.</li>
<li>The purpose of the engaging perspective is to move from designers seeing the user as a stereotype with whom they are unable to identify and whose life they cannot envision, to designers actively involving themselves in the lives of the personas.</li>
<li>Other persona perspectives are criticized for causing a risk of stereotypical descriptions by not looking at the whole person, but instead focusing only on behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fictional aka Proto</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does not emerge from traditional user research but it emerges from synthesized real world observation.</li>
<li>Based upon past interactions with the user base.</li>
<li>Deliver a picture of what, <strong>perhaps</strong>, typical users look like. You may be able to use them as an initial sketch of user needs.</li>
<li>*These personas can be deeply flawed.</li>
<li>They allow for early involvement with your users in the UX design process, but they <strong>should not be trusted as truth for your development of products or services. The assumptions should be validated.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Building, Using and Iterating on Personas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Collect data</li>
  <li>Analyze data and hypothesize</li>
  <li><strong>Get feedback on conclusions.</strong> This is important to create organizational trust and buy in.</li>
  <li>Decide how many personas are needed for your project.</li>
  <li></strong>Describe the persona</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>include details about the user’s education, lifestyle, interests, values, goals, needs, limitations, desires, attitudes, and patterns of behaviour.</li>
      <li>Include some fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character.</li>
      <li>Give your persona a name. "Sam the sales rep"</li>
      <li>Give your persona an image (not of someone you know, or a famous person - it could create bias)</li>
    </ul>
  <li><strong>Prepare scenarios</strong> (problems the user faces that would trigger the need for your product)</li>
  <li><strong>Get feedback on scenarios.</strong> This is important to create organizational trust and buy in.</li>
  <li><strong>Share the persona.</strong> Decide how you will share with the company, and ensure it is accessible for future employees, externally etc. </li>
  <li>Build a culture where <strong>everyone creates scenarios</strong>, and personas are referenced company wide when talking about the product/website/app etc. (You do not want anyone be referring to personas as "the user".)</li>
  <li><strong>Iterate</strong>. As new scenarios are written, new information will become available. This should be collaborative with anyone who is interacting with real users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designing for everyone means that everyone is disappointed with the result.</li>
  <li>Designing for the "average" user typically does not work.</li>
  <li>Persona types can and should be combined to tell the best story.</li>
  <li>Persona should be based on real research. Even if you are starting out with a fictional / proto persona, the information should be validated and updated as you complete your research.</li>
  <li>Personas should not be based on individual people, people that you know, famous people, or yourself. 
</ul>
