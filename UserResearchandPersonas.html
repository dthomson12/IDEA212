 <h2>User Research and Personas</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>What is a persona?</h3>
  
<p>Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way.</p>
  
<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Help you to understand your users’ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.</li>
<li>Help you step out of yourself. </li>
<li>Help you to recognise that different people have different needs and expectations.</li>
<li>Help you to empathize with the user you’re designing for.</li>
<li>Make the design task at hand less complex as they will guide your ideation processes.</li>
<li><strong>Help you to achieve the goal of creating a good user experience for your target user group</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of personas</h3>
<p>There are 4 different types of personas that can add value to your design project.</p>

<h4>Goal Directed</h4>
<ul>
<li>What does my typical user want to do with my product?</li>
<li>Examine the process and workflow that your user would prefer to utilise in order to achieve their objectives in interacting with your product or service.</li>
<li>There is an assumption that you have already done enough user research to recognise that your product has value to the user.</li>
<li>By examining their goals, you can bring their requirements to life.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Role-Based</h4>
<ul>
<li>Role-based perspectives are data-driven and incorporate data from both qualitative and quantitative sources.</li>
<li>Focusses on the user’s role in the organisation. Our designs need to reflect upon the part that our users play in their organisations or wider lives.</li>
<li>An examination of the roles that our users typically play in real life can help inform better product design decisions.</li> 
<ul>
<li>Where will the product be used?</li> 
<li>What’s this role’s purpose?</li> 
<li>What business objectives are required of this role?</li> 
<li>Who else is impacted by the duties of this role?</li> 
<li>What functions are served by this role?</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Engaging</h4>
<ul>
<li>Perspective is rooted in the ability of stories to produce involvement and insight.</li>
<li>Through an understanding of characters and stories, it is possible to create a vivid and realistic description of fictitious people.</li>
<li>The purpose of the engaging perspective is to move from designers seeing the user as a stereotype with whom they are unable to identify and whose life they cannot envision, to designers actively involving themselves in the lives of the personas.</li>
<li>Other persona perspectives are criticized for causing a risk of stereotypical descriptions by not looking at the whole person, but instead focusing only on behavior.</li>
</ul>
