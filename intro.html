<h3>What do I expect you to get out of it</h3>

<p>This course should prepare you with the fundamental concepts you will need to understand for any design job, whether it be graphic / visual design, web or app design, or product design. The goal is to frame the way you think about problems, and how to solve problems, or get to solutions that meet the needs of the human you are solving for.</p>

<h3>Concepts vs. aesthetics</h3>

<p>This course is not primarily about the aesthetics of your websites/digital branding work. This course is about understanding your users, understanding UX best practices including navigation, organizing information, happy paths, and understanding the steps you need to take before you start making beautiful designs and interfaces. That being said, if your beautiful designs negatively impact usability, that will be part of my critiques.</p>

<h3>What should you expect from me?</h3>

<ul>
<li>I will aim to deliver the material in a clear, and informative way. </li>
<li>I will share my industry experiences whenever possible. I have a lot of stories. </li>
<li>I will be available to answer questions during class, but also outside of class via Slack or Email.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I expect from you.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be on time.</li>
<li>This shows that we respect each other. It's important.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Participate</h3>

<p>You and your peers and even I will get more out of this experience if you participate. You paid good money to be here. The best way to get the most value for that money is to participate.</p>

<p>Spelling and grammar matter. Always present your material as if a client or stakeholder was the audience. 
(Dont use placeholder text that could be percieved as offensive.)</p>

<h3>Deadlines matter</h3>

<p>20% will be deducted from the assignment grade for every day that an assignment is late, unless prior arrangements are made with me.</p>

<h3>Fail fast. Fail cheap. Fail often</h3>

<p>This means that you should come and show me work in progress. You should ask me questions as you work through problems; however, I cannot make you do this. I am assuming you are a grown up and you will make these choices on your own. I will remind you that showing me work in progress is a good idea from time to time. Youâ€™ll learn more if you do it and your marks will improve.
</br>
Mostly, I expect you to put in effort</p>


<h3>Logistics and Housekeeping</h3>

<ul>
<li>Office Hours</li>
<li>My day job (and work travel)</li>
<li>Software</li>
<li>Textbooks</li>
</ul>
