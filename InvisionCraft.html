<h3>Assignment - 30% of final grade. Must be submitted and presented on April 3 2020</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clickable Prototype - Final Designs & Interactions</strong></li>
<li>The previous assignments related to moodboards / style tiles, low fidelity wireframes, and UI kit / design system should make this completion of this assignment easier. Please consider feedback that has been provided, especially with regard to your wireframes.</li>
<li>Build a clickable version of your final website. This should be a fully designed website that has the look and feel of something that you would visit online. Your website should allow the user to search/browse products, and filter down those results. It should also allow a user to add a product to the the cart, and complete a payment for that product. I expect that you reviewed the feedback provided in your low fidelity wireframes project, and that you take that feedback and incorporate it into your final project. Your final project should also be branded with color, fonts and look like a real website.</li>
<li><strong>Exceptions: Content pages can be duplicates if you use generic language in your designs. This means if you have an "about us" page, and a "delivery and returns page" you can use the same artboard if you use generic naming conventions such as "Content Page Title", lorem ipsum text etc. We have discussed this in class. If you have questions, please ask. </strong></li>
<li>You should pay attention to your use of symbols and interaction within your site. You will be marked on efficiency. We have also talked about this in class.</li>
</ul>

  <tr>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Items that appear on more than 1 screen are created as symbols, and the interactions are built into the symbols using craft/sketch (not invision). Eg. This means navigation / footers vs buttons that may look the same, but do different things. When elements look the same but do different things, they should be treated as page level interactions instead of component level interactions. The exception is content pages, and product tiles/cards as discussed in class.</td>

    Visual Design: You follow UX best practices and your final designs offer a good user experience. Eg. Font sizes make sense, colors make sense. (dont use a white text on a very light colored background color)
