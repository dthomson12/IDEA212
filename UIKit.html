 <h2>Design System: UIKit Overview - Symbols</h2>
 <hr>
<h3>Atomic Design</h3>
<p>What our interfaces are comprised of and how we can construct design systems in a more methodical way.</p>
<p>A reusable group of components that can be shared and used by multiple teams or projects.</p>

<img src="Atomic_UI_Elements.png"></p> 

<h3>Sketch Library</h3>

<p>A Library is basically a Sketch file/document containing Symbols that can be used globally (as opposed to just locally).
You can share a Library by either storing it on a Local Server, by using a Cloud Service such as Dropbox, or even via a Version Control system like GitHub or Abstract. As a result, you and your teammates can have access to the same Libraries from one central location.</p>

<h4>Create a Library</h4>

<ul>
<li>Add a new sketch file</li>
<li>Save the file as ClientName_Library (for your assignment, save it as FirstNameLastName_Library.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bring a library (or as many as you want) into Sketch</h4>

<p>Manually add it as a Sketch Library via Preferences > Libraries > Add Library.</p>

<h4>Naming Conventions are IMPORTANT</h4>

<p>There are many different file structures / naming conventions that you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atomic Design (Based on logical use cases. "PrimaryButton/Active vs Button/Blue)</li>
<li>OOCSS</li>
<li>SMACSS</li>
<li>Conventions that are easy to apply for working in Sketch is BEM.</li>
</ul>

<h4>BEM (Block Element Modifier)</h4>

<img src="BEM.png"></p> 

<ul>
<li>EG Button/Primary/Enabled</li>
<li>EG Button/Primary/Disabled</li>
<li>EG Button/Secondary/Enabled</li>
<li>EG Button/Secondary/Disabled</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adding Colors</h4>

<p>Add boxes of the same size and style them using your primary and secondary colors. In the right panel under "Appearance" add a new layer style.</p>
<p>eg. Naming Convention: Palette/Primary/Black</p>
  
<img src="Appearance.png"></p> 

<h4>Adding Typography</h4>

<p>Add text layers for H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, link, body etc. In the right panel under "Appearance" add a new layer style.</p>
<p>eg. Naming Convention: Text/H1</p>

<img src="TextAppearance.png"></p> 

<h4>Why use Symbols</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reusability</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Source of Truth</li>
<li>Dynamic and Editable</li>
<li>Organization</li>
</ul>

<h4>Atomic Symbols which will be necessary next class for use in our reusable components (next class & assignment)</h4>
 
<ul>
<li>Color Palette (Primary / Secondary)</li>
<li>Text Inputs (enabled, disabled)</li>
<li>Radio Buttons (enabled / disabled)</li>
<li>Checkboxes (Enabled / Disabled/ Checked / Unchecked)</li>
<li>Typography (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, body (paragraph), Link)</li>
<li>Section Dividers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2 Class Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Review of Atomic Design</li>
  <li>Review of Naming Conventions</li>
  <li>Review of Atom Components </li>
  <li>Building Molecules and Organisms</li>
  <li>Best practices for building components (symbols) efficiently and accurately.</li>
  <li>Best practices for building designs with reusable components.</li>
  <li>Master vs Instance</li>
  <li>Master changes and their cascading impacts</li>
  <li>Assignment Overview</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design System Assignment Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>File Name is formatted as <strong>FirstName_LastName_UIKit_Library.sketch</strong></li>
  <li>Your name is included at the bottom of your sketch artboard.</li>
  <li>Submit one artboard contains all of the required content as outlined below. It is organized logically, and easy to follow.</li>
  </ul>
